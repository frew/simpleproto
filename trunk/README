simpleproto requires that Google protocol buffers are already installed.
Download at:
  http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
You can install protocol buffers locally via
  ./configure --prefix={insert dir here} && make && make install
If you do this, you'll want to pass the prefix to scons.py with:
  python scons.py --protobuf-prefix={insert dir here}

To build the graphics server:
  python scons.py server

To build the library:
  python scons.py libs

To build tests (executable from build/test/<executable>):
  python scons.py tests

To build everything:
  python scons.py

By default the files are installed to ./export (so you can run 
 ./export/bin/graphics_server for the server or link against 
 ./export/lib/libsimpleprotographics.a for the client). You can change
this by adding a --prefix command line argument: 
  python scons.py server --prefix=/usr/local
