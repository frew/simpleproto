To build the graphics server:
  python scons.py server

To build the library:
  python scons.py libs

To build everything:
  python scons.py

By default the files are installed to ./export (so you can run 
 ./export/bin/graphics_server for the server or link against 
 ./export/lib/libsimpleprotographics.a for the client). You can change
this by adding a --prefix command line argument: 
  python scons.py server --prefix=/usr/local
